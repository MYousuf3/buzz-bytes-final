Problem: Navigating the diverse array of food options at Georgia Tech's dining halls can be a challenge. Students with specific dietary restrictions (such as calorie intake, Halal, Vegan, or Vegetarian preferences) often find it hard to curate meals that align with their nutritional needs. Additionally, deciding which dining hall to visit and choosing the right meal for the time of day can be overwhelming.

Our Project: Introducing Buzz Bytes, your ultimate solution to dining hall dilemmas. Buzz Bytes is a user-friendly web application tailored to the unique needs of Georgia Tech students. It empowers you to create meals that cater to your dietary restrictions, preferences, and nutritional goals, all within the bustling dining hall environment.
Our Solution: Buzz Bytes ingeniously combines cutting-edge technologies to simplify your dining hall experience. Our software seamlessly integrates the robust Nutrislice API provided by the university's dining halls with an external nutrition API to fill in any missing data gaps. The result is a comprehensive dataset of dining hall meals, complete with detailed nutritional information.

The heart of Buzz Bytes lies in its utilization of Language Model (LLM) algorithms. These algorithms work behind the scenes to generate meal combinations based on the available food items and your specific dietary restrictions. Whether you're counting calories, seeking Halal options, embracing a vegan lifestyle, or enjoying a vegetarian diet, Buzz Bytes offers tailored meal suggestions to meet your needs.
In addition to meal planning, Buzz Bytes helps you achieve your nutritional goals. It calculates the exact number of servings required to reach your daily caloric intake objectives, ensuring you stay on track with your dietary plan.
